# Low Issues

## L-1: `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability

The `ecrecover` function is susceptible to signature malleability. This means that the same message can be signed in multiple ways, allowing an attacker to change the message signature without invalidating it. This can lead to unexpected behavior in smart contracts, such as the loss of funds or the ability to bypass access control. Consider using OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library instead of the built-in function.

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 111](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L111)

	```solidity
	        address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(
	```



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 231](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L231)

	```solidity
	        lpETH.approve(address(lpETHVault), claimedAmount);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 495](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L495)

	```solidity
	        require(_sellToken.approve(exchangeProxy, _amount));
	```



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 2](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.6.2 <0.9.0;
	```

- Found in src/interfaces/IWETH.sol [Line: 2](src/interfaces/IWETH.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.5.0;
	```



## L-4: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

## L-5: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 54](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L54)

	```solidity
	    function initialize(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint8 _decimals) public {
	```

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 71](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L71)

	```solidity
	    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
	```

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 79](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L79)

	```solidity
	    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
	```

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 88](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L88)

	```solidity
	    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
	```

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 105](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L105)

	```solidity
	    function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
	```



## L-6: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

- Found in src/mock/AttackContract.sol [Line: 20](src/mock/AttackContract.sol#L20)

	```solidity
	        prelaunchPoints.claim(ETH, 100, PrelaunchPoints.Exchange.UniswapV3, emptydata);
	```

- Found in src/mock/AttackContract.sol [Line: 27](src/mock/AttackContract.sol#L27)

	```solidity
	            prelaunchPoints.claim(ETH, 100, PrelaunchPoints.Exchange.UniswapV3, emptydata);
	```



## L-7: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 11](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount);
	```

- Found in lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol [Line: 13](lib/forge-std/src/mocks/MockERC20.sol#L13)

	```solidity
	    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 amount);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 56](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L56)

	```solidity
	    event Locked(address indexed user, uint256 amount, address token, bytes32 indexed referral);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 57](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	    event StakedVault(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 58](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L58)

	```solidity
	    event Converted(uint256 amountETH, uint256 amountlpETH);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 59](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L59)

	```solidity
	    event Withdrawn(address indexed user, address token, uint256 amount);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 60](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L60)

	```solidity
	    event Claimed(address indexed user, address token, uint256 reward);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 61](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L61)

	```solidity
	    event Recovered(address token, uint256 amount);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 62](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L62)

	```solidity
	    event OwnerUpdated(address newOwner);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 63](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L63)

	```solidity
	    event LoopAddressesUpdated(address loopAddress, address vaultAddress);
	```

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 64](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L64)

	```solidity
	    event SwappedTokens(address sellToken, uint256 sellAmount, uint256 buyETHAmount);
	```



## L-8: Empty `require()` / `revert()` statements

Use descriptive reason strings or custom errors for revert paths.

- Found in src/PrelaunchPoints.sol [Line: 495](src/PrelaunchPoints.sol#L495)

	```solidity
	        require(_sellToken.approve(exchangeProxy, _amount));
	```



## L-9: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
